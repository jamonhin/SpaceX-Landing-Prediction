# SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction Project

This repository contains the complete analysis and machine learning project aimed at predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket landings. By predicting whether the Falcon 9's first stage will successfully land, we aim to understand key factors influencing landing outcomes and provide insights into optimizing launch costs.

## Project Overview

The project uses a combination of data science techniques, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data wrangling, and machine learning, to analyze and predict landing outcomes. The primary objectives are to:

- Explore and visualize SpaceX launch data to identify patterns and trends.
- Develop a predictive model to forecast the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings.
- Leverage SQL queries, Python, and machine learning to gain data-driven insights.
